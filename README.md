# SOLID Principles Project

This project provides a detailed explanation of the **SOLID** principles, which are fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming and software design. Each principle is explained in a separate file, and you can find the links to those files below.

## Introduction to SOLID Principles

The **SOLID** principles are a set of five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. The acronym **SOLID** stands for:

- **S**ingle Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- **O**pen/Closed Principle (OCP)
- **L**iskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- **I**nterface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- **D**ependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

Each principle is described in detail in the following sections.

## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

The **Single Responsibility Principle** states that a class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility.

## Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

The **Open/Closed Principle** states that software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.

[Read more about OCP](./2-openClosedPrinciple.md)

## Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

The **Liskov Substitution Principle** states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.

## Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

The **Interface Segregation Principle** states that no client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use. In other words, interfaces should be specific to the needs of the client.

[Read more about ISP](./4-interfaceSegregationPrinciple.md)

## Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

The **Dependency Inversion Principle** states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Additionally, abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

## Conclusion

Understanding and applying the SOLID principles can significantly improve the quality of your software design. By following these principles, you can create systems that are easier to maintain, extend, and understand.
